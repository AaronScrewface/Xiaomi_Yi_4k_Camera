# Yi 4k+ increased framerate mod

Just click in the folder that corresponds to you firmware version and follow 
the instructions.

Note: if your camera starts up on a mode that was modified you must refresh it 
by going to picture mode and back to make the camera reinit the firmware.

These modes are achieved by overclocking the camera sensor. The current 
bottleneck once the sensor is overclocked seems to be the dsp, core or memory 
which could likely be overclocked at the expense of battery life. I just don't 
know how to overclock them yet.

Currently the only increased mode is 1080p 120fps -> 150fps.
