Put [autoexec.ash](https://github.com/irungentoo/Xiaomi_Yi_4k_Camera/raw/master/4k+/shutter_custom_values/1.4.9/autoexec.ash) in the root of your sd card. IMPORTANT: if you are on windows you must save page as (download) this file, if you copy paste its contents it will not work because it needs to have unix line endings (and an empty line at the end). If you want to edit this file, get an editor like Notepad++ that supports unix line endings.

For an explanation see: [Readme.md](../Readme.md)
