## 4000x2700 4k ultra mod for the Yi 4k on en_US firmware 1.40.

Makes the 4k ultra mode have a resolution of 4000x2700.

Note, this is best used with the [Bitrate Mod](../bitrate_mod). For a script that combines both these mods see: [my autoexec.ash](../my_autoexec.ash)

Put [autoexec.ash](https://github.com/irungentoo/Xiaomi_Yi_4k_Camera/raw/master/4000x2700_4k_ultra_mod/autoexec.ash) in the root of your sd card. IMPORTANT: if you are on windows you must save page as (download) this file, if you copy paste its contents it will not work because it needs to have unix line endings (and an empty line at the end). If you want to edit this file, get an editor like Notepad++ that supports unix line endings.
