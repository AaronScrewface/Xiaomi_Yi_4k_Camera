## Notes on Some Camera Settings

### Sharpness

Enables some shitty post processing sharpening filter. Setting it to low seems to disable it.

### Ultra modes

Superview modes as they are called in the firmware. They have a bigger field of view than the normal modes.

### Electronic Image Stabilization

Stabilizes the video but makes it look like a blurry piece of shit at least in the 2.7K mode.
